## Types of copyright for music
Compositions are usually owned by songwriters and/or publishers. Sound recordings are usually owned by artists or labels.
- - **<span style="color:red">The Composition**  — which is the music and lyrics.
- - **<span style="color:red">The Sound Recording**  — which is a particular recorded version of that music and lyrics.
- **Mechanical Royalty** - When your composition is reproduced in any medium you are owed a separate type of royalty called a mechanical royalty. 
Every time a song you’ve written is manufactured to be sold in a CD, downloaded on a digital music retail site, or streamed through services like Spotify and Apple Music, you are owed a mechanical royalty.

- **Performance Royalties** -  are another form of publishing royalty, owed to publishers and songwriters when their compositions are played on the radio, performed in public, and more.

- **Neighboring Rights** - Same as performance rights but for record labels.

- **Digital Royalties** - are fees that service providers such as Pandora, SiriusXM and webcasters are required by law to pay for streaming musical content.
- **Sync Licensing** - “Synchronization” is the act of pairing audio with moving images — video, film, TV, commercials, video games, corporate presentations, etc.
