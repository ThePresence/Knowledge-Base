  - Strings ("Name" , "Hello" ...)
  - Boolean ( True, False)

- **Operators**  - (-, +, *, /, =, !=, <, > ...)

  - Making arithmetic calculations
  - Comparing information
  - Creating logical expressions

- **Functions**  -

  ​  A function is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit. 

- **Control Flow**  -

  - *Control flow is the order in which instructions are executed.* 
  - *Programs* are a set of instructions, executed in a certain order. This order, called *control flow*. Conditions, Loops and Exception (if-else, do-while etc) 

- **Lists**  -

  - A *list* is an ordered sequence of information 
  - Lists *order* items so that they’re in a specific sequence.
