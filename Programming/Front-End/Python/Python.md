I haven't watched many YouTube videos on Python, but I REALLY enjoyed this YouTube video, https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw All the examples are very simple, yet very informative and straight to the point. The 4hrs is actually not that long imo because it should engage you. I would recommend watching this along with reading Automate the Boring Stuff and Crash Course from No Starch Press.

These cheat sheets from Python Crash Course are also very useful!  https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html

This Python editor is also useful for learning purposes: https://codewith.mu

This is a great site also for visualizing how your code works: http://www.pythontutor.com

Fyi, this site is great finding learning resources. Toggling "Free" in the search filter should help find most best free resources out there. https://hackr.io/

Let's see what happens next
